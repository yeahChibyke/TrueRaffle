# TrueRaffle 

## About

This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery

## What do I want it to do?

- Users enter the raffle by paying for a ticket
  - Ticket fees goes to the winner after the draw
- After a set period of time the lottery will automatically draw a winner
  - And this will be done programmatically
- Utilize Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation
  - Chainlink VRF ----> Randomness
  - Chainlink Automation ----> Time-based trigger
